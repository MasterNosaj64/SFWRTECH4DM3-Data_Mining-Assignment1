#Data Mining - Assignment 1 - SFWRTECH4DM3 - McMaster University - Software Engineering

The purpose of this code is to calculate various dissimilarity matrices for different types of data, including numeric, binary, ordinal, and nominal data, using various distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Supremum. It processes multiple data tables to determine how dissimilar or similar data points are to each other based on these metrics. The code also includes printing functions to display the matrices and uses mathematical operations and comparisons to compute the distances.
